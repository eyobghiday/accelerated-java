# CS 201 Accelerated Java Programming using Eclipse. 

This repository will contain all assignments, exams, and projects that you will be working on throughout the semester. There may not be much in it at the start, but more will be added as time goes on, including additional work as well as grades for completed work.

## Project Sections

This Project is divided into three sections, in order of importance and content flow. 
1. Lectures
2. Labs
3. Exams
First do clone the lectures and watch what you can pick up. Then do the labs. The Labs are for you to do. Do not copy and but instead think about what you're asked in the each section. Each folder lab has it's own questions in the ReadME.md file. Make sure to read the assignment and then try to code them  on your Eclipse IDE. Then compare your answers with my solutions.
 
## Course Information

1. Read the readme file for every Lab folder there's in the repository. 
2. Each readme file has an exercise for you to practice. Usually 3 or 4 questions. 
3. Try to code some on your own first, then check to see if yours is something similar to mine. 
4. Make some changes, edit and compare yours with mine.
5. Try at least one lab exercise in one week. 
6. Continue doing this for 3 months, and you'll master Java coding no less. 
7. Congratulations you just gained yourself a handful skill to update in your resume.
