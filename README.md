# Accelerated Java Programming using Eclipse. 
This is a compilation of Java programs I wrote for anyone willing to study and learn the Java language. It's a collection of assignments and projects I wrote for one of my CS classes in Eclipse. As always let me know if you have questions.

This repository contains all neccessary assignments, exams, and projects you need to understand java. There may not be much in it at the start, but I will add more as time goes on, including additional work as well as descriptions for the completed work.

## Project Sections

This Project is divided into three sections, in order of importance and content flow. 
1. Lectures
2. Labs
3. Exams

First do clone the lectures and read go over the codes. Then do the labs. The Labs are for you to do. Do not copy my solutions, instead think about what you're asked in each section. Each folder in the lab has its own questions in the ReadME.md file. Make sure to read the assignment and then try to code them using Eclipse IDE. Then compare your answers with my solutions.

## Eclipse Setup

Eclipse can be downloaded from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. And from that you can set up your project folder and path for the compiler. It's straight forward and super easy to use. It's GUI based, henceforth sefl explanatory. 
It's quite possible that you need to update your Java or download a new one if you don't have one. The Java compiler is neccessary to run Eclipse and can be downloaded from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/.
 
## Course Information

1. Read the readme file for every Lab folder there's in the repository. 
2. Each readme file has an exercise for you to practice. Usually 3 or 4 questions. 
3. Try to code some on your own first, then check to see if yours is something similar to mine. 
4. Make some changes, edit and compare yours with mine.
5. Try at least one lab exercise in one week. 
6. Continue doing this for 3 months, and you'll master Java coding no less. 
7. Congratulations you just gained yourself a handful skill to update in your resume.
