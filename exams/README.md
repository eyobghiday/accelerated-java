# CS 201 Accelerated Java Programming using Eclipse. 

## Labs
The Labs are for you to do. Do not copy and but instead think about what you're asked in the each section. Each folder lab has it's own questions in the ReadME.md file. Take a note and then try to code them using on your Eclipse IDE. Then compare your answers with mine.
