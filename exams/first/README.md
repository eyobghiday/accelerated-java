# Midterm Exam

You will have 24 hours to complete this exam. You are allowed to use any outside notes or resources, but all work must be your own. Any code found not to be your own work will not be graded. Make sure to read _all_ the instructions for each question carefully and answer each question completely. Once you have finished, please commit and push your work to your repository. Please also confirm that the code is in your remote repository, i.e. that it is on bitbucket.org.

## Question One: Selection

Write a Java program that will prompt the user for a letter. If the letter is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u') print out "Vowel". If the letter is not a vowel, print out "Consonant".

## Question Two: Repetition

Write a Java program that will prompt the user to enter an integer and prints out every positive, odd integer less than or equal to that number. For example, if the user enters 6, the program would print out the following:

```
1 3 5
```

## Question Three: Arrays

Write a Java program that will prompt the user for 10 integers, which are stored in an array, and returns the integer that occurs the most frequently.

**NOTE:** 

- Your program must use an array.
- Do not sort the array or use ArrayLists.
- If multiple values occur equally many times, you only need to return one of them.

## Question Four: Objects

Write a Java class based on the following UML diagram. Include all standard methods, such as constructors, mutators, accessors, toString, and equals. Additionally, implement any methods shown in the diagram.

**NOTES:**

- Both `height` and `width` should only ever be positive (i.e. greater than 0).
- The perimeter of a rectangle is `2 * (height + width)`.
- The area of a rectangle is `height * width`.
