2. Learn to use Java data types
3. Learn to use selection control structures

## Exercises

1. Write a program that will do the following:

  - Prompt the user for a temperature in Fahrenheit, convert the Fahrenheit to Celsius and display the result.
  - Prompt the user for a temperature in Celsius, convert the Celsius to Fahrenheit and display the result.
  - Test your program with various temperatures: low, high, middle. Use a test table with as many rows as needed to test your program. Are you satisfied that your program works as expected? Submit your test plan and its results.

2. Write a program that will convert inches to centimeters:

  - Prompt the user for inches.
  - Convert inches to centimeters.
  - Display the result to the console.
  - Test your program with various inputs. Use a test table like above with as many rows as needed to test your program.

3. Write a Java program that will prompt the user for a number and print out a triangle with those dimensions. For example, if the user enters 5, return the following:
```
    *
    * *
    * * *
    * * * *
    * * * * *
```

4. Write a Java program that will prompt the user for the grades for an exam, computes the average, and returns the result. Your program must be able to handle an unspecified number of grades.

  (Hint: Tell the user to enter -1 when they finished entering grades)

  Be sure to test your code with a variety of values and number of grades.
