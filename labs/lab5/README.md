# Lab 5 - Sorting

## 07/23/2021

## Objectives

1. Learn to write and use sorting algorithms

## Exercises

1. Write a Java program that will prompt the user for Strings until they enter "done". Once they have finished entering Strings, sort them using Bubble Sort and ordered by their length. For example, if the user entered the following, they should get this output:

    Input: `["frog", "another word", "digging", "apple", "cat"]`
    Output: `["cat", "frog", "apple", "digging", "another word"]`

2. Write a Java program that will prompt the user for numbers until they enter "done". Once they are finished entering numbers, sort them using Insertion Sort.

    **NOTE**: You should ensure that the only values being sorted are numbers, but you do not need to repeatedly prompt them if they enter an invalid number; just say that it is invalid and move on to the next prompt without storing it.

3. Write a Java program that will prompt the user for Strings until they enter "done". Once they have finished entering Strings, sort them using Selection Sort and ordered alphabetically (using `compareTo`).
