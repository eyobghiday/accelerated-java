# Lab 6 - Searching Algorithms

## 07/30/2021

## Objectives

1. Learn to use searching algorithms
2. Learn to use recursion in the implementation of algorithms

## Exercise

1. Write a Java program that implements the Sequential Search algorithm as a method and allows the user to search for a term in the following array:

    ```
    {"a", "bee", "sea", "dog", "egg", "fun"}
    ```

2. Write a Java program that implements the Binary Search algorithm (using iteration) as a method and allows the user to search for a term in the following array:

    ```
    {"a", "bee", "dog", "egg", "fun", "sea"}
    ```

3. Write a Java program that implements the Binary Search algorithm (using recursion) as a method and allows the user to search for termin the following array:

    ```
    {"c", "html", "java", "python", "ruby", "scala"}
    ```
